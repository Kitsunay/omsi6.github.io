# Idle Loops - Kitsunay's tweaks and (subjective) gameplay improvements
Idle Loops is an idle game with an interesting concept of starting with extremely little mana and short loops and slowly building knowledge about the world around you, collecting more mana to make your loops longer and do more stuff. While I found this game fun to play, it felt slow. Really slow. So I made a few changes to the way how this game's engine works:
- the game runs at 8x speed permanently
- you have a base 8x exp multiplier for your attributes (every 1 mana spent provides in 8 exp)
- exp multipliers of talents and soulstones have been revamped to talent_soulstone_level ^ 0.9 / 10

With this faster tempo, I found the game to be far more enjoyable and I hope you will have the same experience and like the faster pace of the game.
